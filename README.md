# Conclusion:

* We can spend 8,3$ ~ 15$ to acquire a new customer even through they going to pay 25$ in the first month and only 60% of that will profit <br/>
* With the Avg Lifetime = 4,5 months, we can make back that 15$ we spend to acquire 1 new customer in Marketing, and then we gonna make additional profit <br/>
* Because of the really fast growing of the new Startup (maybe 200%~300%), we need to predict using historical Churn rate to reduce the cost on Marketing<br/>
